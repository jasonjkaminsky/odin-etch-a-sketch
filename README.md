Things I learned from doing this project:
- Javascript practice to makes grids with varying numbers of cells
- DOM manipulation with Javascript and using methods such as appendChild(), removeChild(), setAttribute(), and classList.add()
- Applying event listeners, such as event.target.style
- CSS practice to work on my creative skills
- HTML
